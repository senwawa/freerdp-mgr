I writed this mostly cause i was bored, but i will maintain it daily.

# Usage
There are three options: 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b45ffad4-886f-49ea-8171-bbf33bdf76b9)

**Connect**
**Create Password Database File**
**Exit**

As soon as you press **Connect** you will just need to input the data and you will be straight in!

## Config File
The first time that you will open up the script a file called **config.conf** will be created.
Inside there are two variables:

**RDP_SIZE**: Size of the virtual monitor
**DOMAIN**: You can leave this empty if you wish, it's for putting a domain so others dont see it and you use it by default
